# Book Search Engine

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a tool designed to allow users to search for any book they and save them onto a personal list that they can access anytime.

## Installation
The search engine can be accessed at the following link: https://secret-mesa-45299.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
Upon first visit the web page, users are presented with a field to search for any books. When a user is not logged in, a searched book will not provide the option to be saved onto the user's saved books list. Once a user signs up or logs in, this option will appear on each searched book. When a user clicks on the 'Save this Book!' button, the book is added onto their personal list. Users can access their personal list of books by clicking on the 'See Your Books' tab on the top right of the navbar. Users are also given the ability to delete any saved books by clicking on the 'Delete this Book!' button.

The search engine is built using Google's books API.
